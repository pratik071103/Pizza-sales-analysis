# Pizza-sales-analysis

ðŸ“„ Project Description
In this project, we analyzed a pizza sales dataset to extract key business insights and create an interactive dashboard for better decision-making. The steps involved were as follows:

Data Import and Setup:
The pizza sales dataset (in CSV format) was first imported into Microsoft SQL Server. A dedicated database was created in SQL Server to store and manage the data.

SQL Queries for Business Analysis:
Using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), we wrote and executed several queries to solve key business problems and derive important Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), including:

Total Revenue

Average Order Value

Total Pizzas Sold

Total Orders

Average Pizzas per Order

Trend and Category Analysis:
We further explored:

Daily trend for total orders

Hourly trend for orders

Percentage of sales by pizza category and size

Total pizzas sold by category

Top 5 and Bottom 5 best-selling pizzas

Cross-verification and Data Cleaning:
After obtaining the results from SQL, we cross-verified the outputs in Excel. We then connected SQL Server directly to Excel to perform a higher level of data cleaning and data processing.

Data Analysis and Visualization:
Advanced data analysis was conducted in Excel using Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts. These visualizations helped summarize the sales data effectively.

Dashboard Creation:
An interactive dashboard was created using Excel, allowing stakeholders to easily explore insights like sales distribution, order trends, and performance of different pizza categories and products.
